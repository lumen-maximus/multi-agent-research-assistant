Research Assistant
Problem Statement
Build a multi-agent research assistant using LangGraph that helps users gather information about companies. The system should have multiple specialized agents working together, support follow-up questions, and request human clarification when queries are ambiguous.

Requirements

1. Agent Architecture
   Implement 4 specialized agents:
   a) Clarity Agent
   Analyzes if the user's query is clear and specific
   Checks if company name is mentioned or if query is too vague
   OUTPUT: Sets clarity_status to "clear" or "needs_clarification"
   ROUTES TO: Interrupt (if unclear) OR Research Agent (if clear)
   b) Research Agent
   Searches for company information (news, financials, recent developments)
   This agent should derive this information from a search tool (Tavily MCP would be preferred) or you can use the mock data below.
   OUTPUT: Returns research findings and assigns a confidence_score (0-10)
   ROUTES TO: Validator Agent (if confidence < 6) OR Synthesis Agent (if confidence ≥ 6)
   c) Validator Agent
   Reviews research quality and completeness
   Checks if information is sufficient to answer the user's question
   OUTPUT: Sets validation_result to "sufficient" or "insufficient"
   ROUTES TO:
   Research Agent (loop back if insufficient AND attempts < 3)
   Synthesis Agent (if sufficient OR max attempts reached)
   d) Synthesis Agent
   Takes research findings and creates a coherent summary
   Formats the response in a user-friendly way
   Maintains context from conversation history
   ROUTES TO: END

2. Core Features to Implement
   Multi-turn Conversation
   Maintain conversation history across multiple queries
   Each agent should access previous messages for context
   Support follow-up questions like "What about their competitors?" or "Tell me more about the CEO"
   Human-in-the-Loop (Interrupt)
   When Clarity Agent detects an unclear query, interrupt the workflow
   Request clarification from the user (e.g., "Which company are you asking about?")
   Resume processing after receiving clarification
   State Management
   Use a proper state schema that includes
   Conditional Routing
   Appropriate routing across the CLarity, Research & Validation agents

3. Mock Data (You Can Use)
   Since you don't need real API calls, mock your research with sample data like:
   mock_research = {
   "Apple Inc.": {
   "recent_news": "Launched Vision Pro, expanding services revenue",
   "stock_info": "Trading at $195, up 45% YTD",
   "key_developments": "AI integration across product line"
   },
   "Tesla": {
   "recent_news": "Cybertruck deliveries ramping up",
   "stock_info": "Trading at $242, volatile quarter",
   "key_developments": "FSD v12 rollout, energy storage growth"
   }
   }
